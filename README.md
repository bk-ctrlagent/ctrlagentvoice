# CtrlAgent Voice Demo

This is a demonstration of more advanced patterns for voice agents, using the OpenAI Realtime API. There are two main patterns demonstrated:
1. **Chat-Supervisor:** A realtime-based chat agent interacts with the user and handles basic tasks, while a more intelligent, text-based supervisor model (e.g., `gpt-4.1`) is used extensively for tool calls and more complex responses. This approach provides an easy onramp and high-quality answers, with a small increase in latency.

## Setup

- This is a Next.js typescript app. Install dependencies with `npm i`.
- Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your env. Either add it to your `.bash_profile` or equivalent, or copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and add it there.
- Start the server with `npm run dev`
- Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It should default to the `chatSupervisor` Agent Config.
- You can change examples via the "Scenario" dropdown in the top right.

# Agentic Pattern 1: Chat-Supervisor

This is demonstrated in the [chatSupervisor](src/app/agentConfigs/chatSupervisor/index.ts) Agent Config. The chat agent uses the realtime model to converse with the user and handle basic tasks, like greeting the user, casual conversation, and collecting information, and a more intelligent, text-based supervisor model (e.g. `gpt-4.1`) is used extensively to handle tool calls and more challenging responses. You can control the decision boundary by "opting in" specific tasks to the chat agent as desired.

## Example
![Screenshot of the Chat Supervisor Flow](/public/screenshot_chat_supervisor.png)
*In this exchange, note the immediate response to collect the phone number, and the deferral to the supervisor agent to handle the tool call and formulate the response. There ~2s between the end of "give me a moment to check on that." being spoken aloud and the start of the "Thanks for waiting. Your last bill...".*

    participant Tool as Tool

    alt Basic chat or info collection
        User->>ChatAgent: User message
        ChatAgent->>User: Responds directly
    else Requires higher intelligence and/or tool call
        User->>ChatAgent: User message
        ChatAgent->>User: "Let me think"
        ChatAgent->>Supervisor: Forwards message/context
        alt Tool call needed
            Supervisor->>Tool: Calls tool
            Tool->>Supervisor: Returns result
        end
        Supervisor->>ChatAgent: Returns response
        ChatAgent->>User: Delivers response
    end
```

## Benefits
- **Simpler onboarding.** If you already have a performant text-based chat agent, you can give that same prompt and set of tools to the supervisor agent, and make some tweaks to the chat agent prompt, you'll have a natural voice agent that will perform on par with your text agent.
- **Simple ramp to a full realtime agent**: Rather than switching your whole agent to the realtime api, you can move one task at a time, taking time to validate and build trust for each before deploying to production.
- **High intelligence**: You benefit from the high intelligence, excellent tool calling and instruction following of models like `gpt-4.1` in your voice agents.
- **Lower cost**: If your chat agent is only being used for basic tasks, you can use the realtime-mini model, which, even when combined with GPT-4.1, should be cheaper than using the full 4o-realtime model.
- **User experience**: It's a more natural conversational experience than using a stitched model architecture, where response latency is often 1.5s or longer after a user has finished speaking. In this architecture, the model responds to the user right away, even if it has to lean on the supervisor agent.
  - However, more assistant responses will start with "Let me think", rather than responding immediately with the full response.

## Modifying for your own agent
1. Update [supervisorAgent](src/app/agentConfigs/chatSupervisorDemo/supervisorAgent.ts).
  - Add your existing text agent prompt and tools if you already have them. This should contain the "meat" of your voice agent logic and be very specific with what it should/shouldn't do and how exactly it should respond. Add this information below `==== Domain-Specific Agent Instructions ====`.
  - You should likely update this prompt to be more appropriate for voice, for example with instructions to be concise and avoiding long lists of items.
2. Update [chatAgent](src/app/agentConfigs/chatSupervisor/index.ts).
  - Customize the chatAgent instructions with your own tone, greeting, etc.
  - Add your tool definitions to `chatAgentInstructions`. We recommend a brief yaml description rather than json to ensure the model doesn't get confused and try calling the tool directly.
  - You can modify the decision boundary by adding new items to the `# Allow List of Permitted Actions` section.
3. To reduce cost, try using `gpt-4o-mini-realtime` for the chatAgent and/or `gpt-4.1-mini` for the supervisor model. To maximize intelligence on particularly difficult or high-stakes tasks, consider trading off latency and adding chain-of-thought to your supervisor prompt, or using an additional reasoning model-based supervisor that uses `o4-mini`.


## Output Guardrails
Assistant messages are checked for safety and compliance using a guardrail function before being finalized in the transcript. This is implemented in [`src/app/hooks/useHandleServerEvent.ts`](src/app/hooks/useHandleServerEvent.ts) as the `processGuardrail` function, which is invoked on each assistant message (after every 5 incremental words received) to run a moderation/classification check. You can review or customize this logic by editing the `processGuardrail` function definition and its invocation inside `useHandleServerEvent`.

## Navigating the UI
- You can select agent scenarios in the Scenario dropdown, and automatically switch to a specific agent with the Agent dropdown.
- The conversation transcript is on the left, including tool calls, tool call responses, and agent changes. Click to expand non-message elements.
- The event log is on the right, showing both client and server events. Click to see the full payload.
- On the bottom, you can disconnect, toggle between automated voice-activity detection or PTT, turn off audio playback, and toggle logs.

## Pull Requests

Feel free to open an issue or pull request and we'll do our best to review it. The spirit of this repo is to demonstrate the core logic for new agentic flows; PRs that go beyond this core scope will likely not be merged.
